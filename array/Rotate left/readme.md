#Rotating an array left

Rotating an array to the left means to shift every element in the array to the left a certain number of places.
To illustrate, take a look at the following example:
 assume we have an array that looks like this:
 `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`
We want to shift this array to the left exactly 3 places.
The end result of this would be an array that looks like this:
`[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]`
As you can see, every element in this array has been moved to the left exactly 3 times, and the ones that "fell out" on the left, have been inserted back in to the right of the array.
