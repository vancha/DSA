The array data structure. This file will hold a couple things related to working with arrays:
- searching through an aray
- reversing an array
- rotating an array
- array search,insert and delete in unsorted array
- array search, insert and delete in sorted array
- array sorting
- generation of all subarrays

After which the goal is to use that in solving a couple of the following questions:
## Easy
